# 02 Advanced CSS: Developer Portfolio

## Description

I was tasked with creating a developer portfolio webpage to showcase my work. The webpage displays my headshot with a brief introduction and three deployed projects. I added a nav bar that takes the user to multiple sections of my webpage with clickable links, screenshots of three of my deployed projects that the User can click on. The webpage itself features a responsive display as I put my elements inside of flex containers. It was designed to be viewable and adjust to any screen size.

## Tasks 

- created a developer landing page so that I can showcase my work.
- created a nav bar with clickable links that takes the user to the corresponding section.
- created clickable screenshots of deployed projects, each has its own title.
- My first project is displayed larger; however, it shrinks if viewport width is less than 1475px.
- Sections of my webpage are flex containers that are responsive to different device sizes and adapts to viewport.
- added comments to css and html files.
